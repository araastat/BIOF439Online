We can create this plot from the beaches dataset.

```{r boxplot, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
beaches <- read_csv('~/Dropbox/teaching/BIOF439/data/sydneybeaches3.csv')
ggplot(beaches, aes(x = fct_reorder(season_name, temperature),
                    y = temperature))+
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = 'Season',
       y = 'Temperature (C)') +
  theme_classic()
```
