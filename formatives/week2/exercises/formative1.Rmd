Packages are user-produced compendiums of functions and data that extend the 
functionality of R. Functions are like recipes, and so packages are like recipe
books. You have to "load" or "activate" a package in R in order to use the functions
inside the package. The standard R way of doing this is by using the `library` function
(yes, it's a package, but you load it using *library*. I know, confusing). For 
example, to load the `tidyverse` package, which is in fact a meta-package that pulls
together 8 other packages (think of this as a boxed set of recipe books), we would
write, in our script, 

```{r, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
── Attaching packages ───────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──
✓ ggplot2 3.3.1     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
✓ tibble  3.0.1     ✓ dplyr   1.0.0
✓ tidyr   1.0.3     ✓ stringr 1.4.0
✓ readr   1.3.1     ✓ forcats 0.5.0
── Conflicts ──────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
```

This output shows up the first time you run this command. You only need to load
a package once **per session**. If you use it multiple times in a session, R just
sees that it's already loaded and does nothing. 

A description of the tidyverse packages is given below:

```{r tidyverse, echo = F, results = 'asis', warning=F, message=F}
library(glue)
tidy_pkgs <- 
  tibble('pkgs' = c('ggplot2','purrr','readr','tidyr',
                    'dplyr','forcats','lubridate','stringr')) %>% 
  mutate(
    # version = map_chr(pkgs, ~packageDescription(., fields='Version')),
    descr = map_chr(pkgs, ~packageDescription(., fields='Description')))

glue_data(tidy_pkgs, 
          "- [**{pkgs}**](http://{pkgs}.tidyverse.org): {descr}")

```

<hr/>

Consider the following piece of code from the lecture

```{r orig-pkg, eval=F}
library(tidyverse)
beaches <- read_csv('data/sydneybeaches3.csv')

ggplot(data = beaches,
       mapping = aes(
         x = temperature,
         y = rainfall
       )
) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Question

Instead of using the full `tidyverse` package, we can just load the packages we
need for this code to run. 

Fill in the blanks in the code below, then **restart R within RStudio** using 
either the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F10` or the menu item `Session > Restart R`. Then copy your code below and see if it produces the graph.

```{r, eval=F}
library(___)
library(___)

beaches <- read_csv('data/sydneybeaches3.csv')

ggplot(data = beaches,
       mapping = aes(
         x = temperature,
         y = rainfall
       )
) + 
  geom_point()

```

## Question

```{r readr, echo=F}
include_graphics(here('graphs/readr.png'))
```

In the **Packages** panel in RStudio, search for the `readr` package. Click on the
package name and it will take you to a list of functions in the package. Write down
other functions that you might find useful in your work, separated by commas.

## Question

Another way of loading data into R that might be easier is the **rio** package, which 
stands for *r import outpu*. Fill in the blanks to (a) install the **rio** package 
on your computer, (b) "activate" the **rio** package, and then (c) use the `import` function from the **rio** package to load the data from the `sydneybeaches3.csv` file
you can download from the course website.

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("___")
library(___)

beaches <- ____("data/sydneybeaches3.csv")
```

## Question

If you looked inside the `install.R` file that you used to install a bunch of 
R packages to your computer, you noticed that I used the **pacman** package and the 
`p_load` function in that file. The `p_load` function combines `install.packages` 
(if needed) and the `library` function to activate a package in your session. This
is great if I'm moving to a new computer or am sharing my code with someone else, 
since it takes care of installing a package if it's not already installed. 

You don't always have to load an entire package into R if you only need one function
from it. R allows you to use a single function from a package using the 
syntax `package::function` (note, two colons).

Load the **mlbench** package into your session using the `p_load` function using the
syntax above. (This package provides several datasets for machine learning). Check
in RStudio's Packages panel to make sure it is installed (you may need to refresh the 
window)

```{r, eval=F}
____::____(mlbench)
```
